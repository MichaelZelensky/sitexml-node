<h1>AJAX-browsing</h1>
<p>What is 'AJAX-browsing'?</p>
<p>Ajax-browsing means a way of browsing sites when requested pages do not load completely, but only a changeable content is loaded, but it lookes and feels like a normal browsing, when URL looks like a unique address, Back/Forward browser buttons work as usual, you can copy URL and paste it another browser window or send it to your mate by mail or instant messenger, et cetera.</p>
<p>The fact is that today every webpage has tons of styling and little meaning content. When we browse a site, every time we click a link on a site's navigation panel we request a whole page, consisting of both styling and content.</p>
<p>Styling part of pages within one site is the same on every page, but we request it every time. This generates excessive load on server, broadband and client. Taking into account the generousity of modern site styling and frontend interactivity, it results in wasting quite a lot of extra kilobytes and seconds for every page we request.</p>
<p>With ajax-browsing, when you click a link on a site's navi panel, you request only meaning content. This is much faster and cheaper in terms of Internet media load (server, broadband, client).</p>
