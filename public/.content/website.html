<h1>The Definition of a Website</h1>
<p>For the technical implementation of the <strong>SiteXML</strong> concept, which extends the Web of Documents to the <strong>Web of Sites</strong>    , we need the following definition:</p>
<p style="background:#ddd; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 10px">A website is a group of hypertext documents that have the same navigation, same styling and are on the same domain.</p>
<p>There is a website in a collective human mind, but no technical definition or standardized implementation of the website. The web that we are using today is actually the Web of Sites, but it is still built on the architecture of the Web of Documents. This definition leads us to the technical implementation of a website.</p>
<p>Speaking not that formally, this definition means that if there is an abstract human user, and this abstract user is browsing several hypertext documents in a row, and if those hypertext documents have the same navigation, same styling and are on the same domain, that abstract human user thinks that he or she is using a website. From the technical point of view, there are no websites, only hypertext documents. However, from the human point of view, there are websites.
</p>
<p>Obviously, this creates an architectural mismatch that leads to many problems of today's web. Using this definition, and a website standard implementation based in it, <strong>SiteXML</strong> can eliminate that mismatch. If we are right, the problems, that come from it, will disappear automatically.</p>
