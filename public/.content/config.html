<h1>SiteXML configuration</h1>

<p>SiteXML backend engine can be configured using optional configuration file, which is located in site root. Changing its options you can influence system-level engine processes related to site/page generation. If no configuration file is present, default rules will be used, so it is no problem if you forget to create this file.</p>
